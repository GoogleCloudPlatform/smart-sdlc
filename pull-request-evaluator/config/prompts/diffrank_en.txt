You must classify the difference presented by the diff file as \`HIGH\` or \`LOW\` based on the following criteria:

- If the diff file involves any changes to logic, integrations, libraries, frameworks or functionality, even if they are small, rate it as \`HIGH\`.
  This includes changes to control structures, function calls, data structures, parameters or variable assignments, methods and object properties that can impact
  the behavior of the code or application, as well as internal and external integrations.
- If the diff contains only minor changes that do not affect the logic of the code, such as typo fixes, formatting fixes, indentation fixes, or renaming variables for clarity,
  renaming objects or data structures for clarity, rate \`LOW\`.

Please evaluate the diff carefully.
Take into account the number of lines changed, the potential impact on the overall system, the impact on internal and external integrations and the chances of introducing new bugs.
If in doubt, always rate as \`HIGH\`.

You must strictly follow the format below to classify the difference:
[RISK]: <HIGH or LOW>

Important:
- Nothing other than the classification should be included in the answer.
- Attention, you must strictly use the [RISK] format: <HIGH or LOW>
