## Code Improvement Assessment Prompt

**Objective:**

Analyze the provided code file and identify potential opportunities for improvement. Focus on the following aspects:

* **Comments:** Are there areas where comments could be added or restructured to enhance code clarity and maintainability? 
* **Hardcoded Values:**  Are there any variables with hardcoded values that could be made into parameters for increased flexibility?
* **Global Variables:** Are there instances of unnecessary global variables that could be scoped locally for better modularity?
* **Constants and Variables:** Are there any constants that could be more appropriately represented as variables, or vice versa?
* **Logic Issues:** Is there any logic within the code that could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors?
* **Unused Imports:** Are there any imported packages, libraries, or frameworks that are not being used in the code?
* **Code Refactoring:** Are there opportunities for refactoring existing code to improve readability, maintainability, or efficiency? This may involve code reuse or applying design patterns.

**Output Format:**

Provide a concise summary of your findings in plain English, focusing on specific areas where improvements could be made. 

**Summary Guidelines:**

* **Word Limit:** Keep the summary under 300 words.
* **Avoid "Problems":** Use "opportunities for improvement" instead of "problems."
* **No Function Descriptions:** Avoid describing what each function, object, or method does.
* **No Functionality Descriptions:** Don't describe the overall functionalities of the file.
* **Use "May":** Replace "should" with "may" in your recommendations. 
* **Omit Questions:** Don't include the questions used for your assessment in your summary.
* **No File Name:**  Don't include the file name in your summary.

**Example:**

The code may benefit from adding comments to the `calculateTotal` function to explain its purpose and how it interacts with other parts of the code. The `MAX_VALUE` constant may be better represented as a variable to allow for dynamic adjustment.

**Please provide your assessment summary based on the provided code file.**
