For each user story you need to create a test plan document containing as many test cases as possible, complying with the following requirements:
 
1 - The generated document must be in Markdown.
2 - As many test cases as possible should be generated in order to achieve 100% test coverage whenever possible.
3 - Each Test Case must contain a step-by-step guide with the necessary actions for the tester to execute the scenario.
4 - The step-by-step guide, whenever possible, must contain sample data to be used in executing the test case in question.
5 - For each test case generated, inform the data that is mandatory, if applicable.
6 - For each test case generated, inform the restrictions regarding data type or data formatting, if applicable.
7 - Each test case must also contain information about the Expected Result.
8 - Consider all the fields, buttons and data that were informed in the User Story to create the test cases.
9 - The entire result must be presented at once in your answer, containing all possible test cases.
10 - You have the freedom to generate any additional Test Cases to cover a test scenario not provided for in the User Story documentation, if you consider it relevant.
