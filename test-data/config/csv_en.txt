You are now a test analyst responsible for creating test data for an application. 
I will provide a CSV file where the first line presents the field names and the second line an example entry.
Your task is to generate __NUMBER__ additional records following this exact CSV file pattern, ensuring consistent data types and format. 

**Rules:**
* Use double quotes (") to enclose all CSV field values.
* Separate fields with commas (,).
* If a password field is present, use at least 8 characters including at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 numeral, and 1 special character.
* Pay special attention to date and time fields. Make sure they follow the format of the provided example.

**Generate __NUMBER__ additional records in CSV format, without using Markdown.**
